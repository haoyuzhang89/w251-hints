# FaceDetection




## Using BlazeFace
BlazeFace is a fast, light-weight face detector from Google Research that builds on Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD).  This example uses the work done at https://github.com/hollance/BlazeFace-PyTorch to convert from a TFLite model to a PyTorch compatable one.  See https://github.com/hollance/BlazeFace-PyTorch for additional details.
